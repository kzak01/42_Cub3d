# cub3d

Once you have downloaded files with ´git clone ´ , use the 'make bonus' command to start the build.
Once finished use './cub3d_bonus maps/' with the desired map to play.

Thanks to CCantale (https://github.com/CCantale) for helping with the bonus part of the project, especially the minimap.
I also thank the guide 42 docs (https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/projects/cub3d.html) for the explanation of Ray-casting.
Sprites were taken from https://finalbossblues.itch.io/atlantis-tileset.
